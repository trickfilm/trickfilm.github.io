### Breaking changes

The CloudFront integration now uses the official Ruby AWS
SDK. As a consequence, the accepted format of the
`cloudfront_distribution_config` is slightly different.

Below are some examples of changes that you have to perform, depending on the
contents of your `cloudfront_distribution_config` setting.

* Rename `min_TTL` -> `min_ttl`
* Change

    ```yaml
    aliases:
      quantity: 1
      items:
        CNAME: my.site.net
    ```

    to

    ```yaml
    aliases:
      quantity: 1
      items:
        - my.site.net
    ```

* There might be other incompatible settings in your old configuration, but
  should them exist, the AWS SDK client will print you a helpful error and then
  safely exit. If this happens, just fix the problems that the CloudFront client
  reports and try again.

Also, the arrays in hashes are now merged:

```
source = {:x => [{:y => 1}]}
dest   = {:x => [{:z => 2}]}
# merge...
Results: {:x => [{:y => 1, :z => 2}]}
```

With the help of array merging, given your config file contains the following
setting:

```yaml
cloudfront_distribution_config:
  origins:
    items:
      - origin_path: /subfolder
```

... `configure-s3-website` will include the `origin_path` setting within the
properties of the first element in the `items` array of your distribution
settings.
