            <b>What Dreams May Come?</b><br>
        by Jesse Lichtenstein<br>
        Post date 10.17.00 &quot;5 Dreams&quot;<br>
        Mixed media animation<br>
        Director: Luke Jaeger<br>
        Country: USA<br>
        Running Time: 7:08<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's October,
          which means it's film festival time here in New York City. And, it
          turns out, in Austin, Los Angeles, Atlantic City, Fort Lauderdale,
          the Hamptons, Denver, Seattle.... The Silverlake neighborhood of Los
          Angeles just had one of its own. The RESFEST 2000 digital film tour
          has already hit San Francisco, Seattle, London, and Chicago, and will
          soon head back to New York for points north and far east. America is
          beset by an epidemic of film festivals--one that appears to be spreading
          well beyond what used to be film's acknowledged quarantines. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The explosion
          of film production has been declared a renaissance, a resurgence, a
          democratic revolution in movies. The agent provocateur, we're told,
          is the arrival of cheap technology--capable of producing high-quality
          digital images--in the hands of legions of aspiring filmmakers. Nor
          are the benefits of digital technology limited to film's means of production.
          Thanks to the Internet, an unprecedented amount of film is available
          to an audience of unprecedented scale. Cyberspace has become one giant
          film festival: the world's largest, which never packs up, never stops
          screening, and turns away relatively little of what's submitted for
          viewing. <br>
        It is a festival with certain shortcomings, of course. If, as the purists
        believe, watching movies on video cripples the art form, then watching
        them on a three-square-inch swath of computer screen would seem to deliver
        an effective coup de grace. (How would Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev fare
        on streaming video?) But let's not get hung up on the current hitches
        in the technology. Let's concede that in terms of cinematography--of
        the force and power of the moving image--streaming online film remains
        crude. The important leap of online film at this point is one of access,
        of allowing countless sketches to exist where there was formerly blank
        space. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Luke Jaeger's
          witty, surreal, and inventive &quot;5 Dreams&quot; 
        is one such creation. Like many of the offerings at Sputnik7, it is a
        short film: a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend 7 minutes and 8 seconds
        of your life (or even 21 minutes and 24 seconds--I got a good deal more
        out of the third viewing than the first). And like many of the short
        films around the Net, it is animated. It's just the sort of film that
        might catch your eye at a film festival then disappear into oblivion.
        Digital technology gives it new and expansive life in cyberspace. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jaeger has
          both excellent absurdist instincts and an ability to subtly reproduce
          the impeccable internal logic of dreams. A narrator (David R. Lenson)--alternately
          deadpan, sarcastic, and silly--leads us through the dream sequence.
          On first viewing, the scenes appear to be a series of non sequiturs:
          the narrator attends a wedding at a seedy hotel, Arnold Schwarzenegger
          is mistaken for a blind man and abducted from a trendy caf&eacute;,
          a terrorist complains about the illogic of irrigation pipe arrangement,
          a subway tunnel suspended beneath a boat threatens to sink, and more.
          But the voiceover continues seamlessly from one episode to the next,
          and the animation makes subtle transitions independent of the spoken
          narrative. Figures or ideas from one dream emerge altered in another,
          much the way dreams alter waking experience with their own internal
          logic and language: the Japanese subway station echoes the appearance
          of a New York subway tunnel in a previous dream; irrigation pipes evoke
          imagined subterranean burrows full of mail--all very strange, but linked
          by association among and throughout the dream narratives. And then
          there are certain non sequiturs which are left unexplained: the surrealism
          of dream-world weirdness that has no waking analog. The result is a
          blurring of dream boundaries and a collapse of sensible narrative; &quot;5
          Dreams&quot;--whichever five of the flurry Jaeger presents that you
          choose to count--inhabits a space between sequential episodes and montage. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Visually,
          Jaeger's mixed-media animation is consistently interesting. Crayon
          seems to be the dominant agent, but Jaeger employs a range of stop-motion
          animation, xerography, photography, and cutout techniques to great
          effect. One of the most impressive moments of this short is a simulation
          of fancy camera work that displays a mastery of shifting perspective
          by someone with an obvious awareness of these details. Were this shot
          on film, the brief scene in the Tokyo subway station--with its pans,
          dips, and weaves past and through colonnades, its ascents and descents--would
          be breathtaking and probably physically impossible, at least barring
          the invention of the indoor helicopter. The other way to make a shot
          like this one work--using computer-generated imaging--would certainly
          be beyond the budget of a short film. As &quot;5 Dreams&quot; shows,
          someone with little money but a mean crayon-hand and a lot of time
          can achieve a splendid version of images that typically require expensive
          equipment and large crews. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not everything
          in this film matches the originality of its high points. There are
          dead spots in the script: for instance, the narrator's question, &quot;Haven't
          you always wondered where letters go after you mail them?&quot; treads
          perilously close to a bad stand-up comedy routine. His delivery, however,
          is generally dead-on elsewhere. Add the excellent soundtrack (featuring 
        &quot;If Wynton Marsalis Had a Toy Boat, Would It Sink?&quot;) and adept
        animation, and there's always something worth attending to. Watch this
        movie, too, for the brief, haunting scene in the bathroom in which the
        dreamer discovers that the tiles in his bathtub are squares from the
        AIDS quilt. In the space of a few seconds, the scene achieves an unexpected
        elegance in such a rough-hewn and consciously eclectic animation-style. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is
          no one film that can hope to encapsulate the breadth of online film,
          which is enormous and growing. But &quot;5 Dreams&quot; 
        is in some sense representative of many films online today: a creation
        that links old production technique to new distribution technology with
        idiosyncrasy and surprise. Jaeger's film gives us a sense of the kinds
        of quirky dreamworlds now available for our consideration twenty-four
        hours a day. It remains to be seen whether the Net will simply present
        the same fare as film festivals or whether the new container will begin
        to shape the contents. This may not make films of the digital era any
        more exotic than Luke Jaeger's crayons, but at least serious film watchers
        will be able to witness the skill with which he wields them. The revolution
        may not be televised--but it will be streamed. </font></p>
