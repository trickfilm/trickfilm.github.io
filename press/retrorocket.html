            <b>Handmade animation</b> <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Luke Jaeger,
          of Northampton, Mass., makes whimsical animated films that display
          the breadth of his storytelling and artistic talents. His work includes &quot;5
          Dreams,&quot; a seven-minute haunting and humorous journey through
          a nocturnal mind, unfolding in serpentine twists of logic. The film
          uses a combination of drawing, painting, photography, Xerography, cutout
          and stop-motion techniques. 
        &quot;5 Dreams&quot; was awarded &quot;Most Technically Innovative Film&quot; at
        the Ann Arbor Film Festival in 1998. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jaeger&#146;s
          animated romp, &quot;Out The Fire,&quot; is set to a 1946 calypso tune,
          and it's about the New York Fire Department. Fire-fighting bulldogs,
          flaming subways, rocket-powered fire extinguishers and sexy skeletons
          cavort through this &quot;retro&quot; music video. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We asked
          him to talk with us about his films and how he makes them. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>RETRO-ROCKET:</b> <b>How
            would you describe your films to someone who has never seen them? </b><br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>LUKE
            JAEGER:</b> I like the phrase &quot;handmade animation&quot; 
        because it describes the process as well as the product. The films really
        are hand-drawn and they look that way. <br>
        Sometimes the illusion of movement is achieved by manipulating collaged
        paper. They all have a structure, and some of them have what you'd call
        a story. I'm more interested in creating some kind of huge and amazing
        visual experience than I am in character and plot. It's an approach to
        animation that I don't see a lot of people practicing in this country.
        There's a genre that people call &quot;experimental&quot; where it's
        understood that you're dealing with film as a visual medium, but American
        animation still tends to be very cartoon-centered. Which is fine, and
        I love cartoons myself. I see my films as being more in a European vein.
        People who haven't been exposed to a lot of animation from other parts
        of the world usually don't know what to make of them. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>How did
            you get started in filmmaking? </b><br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Believe
          it or not, I always knew I wanted to do animation. It took me until
          college to actually attempt it myself. After college I did some commercial
          animation and effects work, and it didn't get me much of anywhere career-wise
          although I met lots of people and learned lots of useful tech stuff.
          Then I had a work-related injury and spent a couple of weeks on my
          back and had plenty of time to think about how much nicer it would
          be to get a job with health insurance. So I took what I'd learned about
          mattes and mask generation and finagled myself a job in offset printing.
          This was way back in the stone age when people still used darkrooms
          and lith film. I kept making films in my evenings and weekends, which
          was hard. I don't know if it would have been any easier had I stayed
          in the industry. Probably not, I think. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What
            is it about film that is unlike other mediums? </b><br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When it's
          projected on a big screen, it's just a beautiful aesthetic experience.
          It sounds corny, but it's magical. It's increasingly rare to be able
          to show films to a big crowd in a theater with a great projection and
          sound system, but when it happens it's unlike anything else. VHS video
          to me is like convenience food. You want to feed your kids in a hurry,
          you make frozen fish sticks. You want to show someone your film conveniently,
          you send them VHS. Everything is so compressed, the color palette is
          squashed down to nothing, the detail is blown out, the sound is raunchy,
          people are getting up to answer the phone in the middle of watching
          your stuff ... it's depressing to me that VHS became the standard format,
          because it's just so bad. Seeing my films transferred to Beta video
          is tolerable but watching them on VHS is like eating airplane food.
          The best thing you can say about it is &quot;this is pretty good for
          airplane food.&quot; <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ann Arbor,
          by the way, is a festival where they really, really care about film
          as an aesthetic experience. That's the whole point of what they're
          doing. There's no star fucking and people acting important and whipping
          their cel phones around. Everyone is just there because they care what
          film looks like on a big screen, in a beautiful theater, with a huge
          crowd. Including the audience, which is not your typical art-film crowd
          ... is &quot;art-film crowd&quot; one of those contradictions-in-terms,
          like &quot;jumbo shrimp&quot;? Somehow the Ann Arbor people get folks
          to turn out in droves to watch these really esoteric films, and the
          audiences go crazy for them. Some of these films, if you saw them under
          crummy conditions, would be about as pleasant as a root canal. But
          they're presented so well that people can really see into them and
          experience them fully. Presentation matters, and film gives you the
          opportunity, at least in theory, to really control how your stuff is
          presented and how things feel when it's shown. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I also like
          film because it is essentially 19th-century technology. You can figure
          out how it works just by looking at it. It's based on real and physical
          things&#151;light and shadows and moving objects. With digital technology,
          you just have to take it on faith that it will work as advertised,
          because only about three people in the world can really understand
          at a fundamental level what is physically going on to make it function. </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's a metaphorical
          realm&#151;you have an interface that approximates some real-world
          elements, and under that you have software and OS and hardware that
          are all metaphors for whatever is happening in the box&#151;even to
          say that &quot;the image is broken down into a pattern of zeroes and
          ones&quot; is a metaphor. I happen to be quite comfortable with digital
          things in general and I do Mac stuff for a living, but I don't find
          it a conducive environment for art. All those metaphors built into
          the medium get in the way of creating new ones. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For getting
          an image onto film, you still can't beat a camera. Even if I enjoyed
          animating on a computer, to be able to project it in a theater would
          require digital output to film, which last time I checked cost about
          $1 per frame. And nobody does digital output to 16mm, so it would cost
          even more because 35mm is inherently more expensive. Digital theater
          projection, I suppose, might be viable one day but I just like film.
          I like how it smells when you put it in the camera. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Who are
            your biggest influences? </b><br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For animation,
          there's Jan Svankmajer, and Chuck Jones, and Terry Gilliam and the
          1930s Fleischer studios. I've also been influenced by a lot of comic
          book artists, like the early MAD guys Wally Wood and Bill Elder, I
          love the way they just cram every picture full of detail. I can come
          back to those and read them over and over and roar with laughter every
          time. <br>
        I've always loved Jack Kirby, the way his drawings are right inside that
        iconic classic 1960's look but also expanding the confines of that look.
        And Kirby's drawings really move&#151;the figures are always posed in
        these extreme postures, very theatrical, expressionist hand gestures.
        I also love Ben Katchor, who does these very dream-like, happy/sad comics
        about old Jewish guys in vanished New York. Those are so much like the
        comics I wish I could do that it's a relief to see someone else doing
        it better than I could. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Animation
          is very tied in to music for me, and a lot of my influences come from
          musicians. James Brown, Fela Kuti, Al Green, 1930s jazz. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Tell
            us a little about the way you work. Do you work alone or with a team? </b><br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mostly alone,
          pressing friends, relatives, acquaintances and strangers into service
          when necessary. Stop-motion is good to have help with because it's
          a kind of performance. Drawn animation, if you're better organized
          than me, you can give someone a scene and tell him what to do with
          it. Sometimes I've been able to pull this off. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Where
            has your work been shown? </b><br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lots of
          festivals, a few classrooms and theatrical engagements. &#147;Out the
          Fire&#148; was shown in a firehouse at the Woods Hole festival, which
          I thought was wonderful. I've had lots of Internet distributors contact
          me, but I've yet to have someone explain to me where the money is supposed
          to come from. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What
            are some of the biggest challenges facing independent filmmakers? </b><br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Too much
          commercialism. The independent film thing has been a bandwagon for
          so many people. So often, when I tell people that I'm not expecting
          to get rich doing this, they look at me with a blank expression. It's
          an expensive medium to work in, so it would be nice if I had bigger
          budgets&#151;I'd love to work in 35mm some day. <br>
