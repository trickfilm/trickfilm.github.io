            <b>In stop time, Jaeger&#146;s world revs with personality </b><br>
        by LARRY PARNASS<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The building
          blocks of Luke Jaeger&#146;s animations rush by at 24 images a second.
          They hurry past to make us believe a lot of things that might never
          enter our minds, were it not for film&#146;s power to hijack our vision.
          We come to believe, in Jaeger&#146;s &#147;Big Concrete Place,&#148; that
          a man with a screw loose, his soul burdened by debt, can be blown with
          his unpaid bills out a window and be the better for it. In his &#147;5
          Dreams,&#148; we watch a subway train rattle along in its tunnel under
          a river, suspended from a toy boat above.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We see in
          such short films the rush of Jaeger&#146;s haunted and absurdist imagination,
          not the repose of its many pieces. We get the dance, not the stance.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For someone
          unaccustomed to gallery shows, the Northampton filmmaker has had a
          lot of work in frames. His current exhibit at the Northampton Center
          for the Arts slows his fecund world down to one frame at a time and,
          in surprising ways, entertains both with its simple ingredients and
          its peculiar whimsy.<br>
        The show comes as Jaeger, 36, prepares to unveil a new animated film, &#147;Old
        Joe&#146;s Hittin&#146; the Jug,&#148; at next month&#146;s Northampton
        Film Festival and as he moves to make art more central to his life. After
        years of holding jobs just to pay bills, he&#146;s now enrolled in a
        master of fine arts program at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston.
        He hopes to parley the credential into a position teaching studio art. 
        &#147;I realized a few years ago that nobody&#146;s making me do this,&#148; he
        said of his art, over coffee the other day at the Haymarket Cafe in Northampton. &#147;It&#146;s
        like coming in from the cold. This isn&#146;t what I do on evenings and
        weekends any more. It&#146;s really what I do. It&#146;s like learning
        to say the words and look at yourself in a certain way, and take it seriously.&#148; For
        Jaeger, the Center for the Arts show, curated by Pam Glaven, is a kind
        of coming-out party for the artist&#146;s humorous and idea-driven works
        _ a kind of pop art with a post-industrial hangover. The pieces arrive
        not with fanfare but as an earnest cross-section of a decade in his creative
        life. He and Glaven have included samples of the things that crowd an
        animator&#146;s attic _ ephemera, film production stills, props and masks.
        Because it stands 15-feet tall, they had to place one piece, the marionette
        Bob that stars in &#147;Old Joe,&#148; in the performance space outside
        the gallery door.<br>
        A videocassette recorder and TV is set up to play three of Jaeger&#146;s
        films _ the two mentioned and &#147;Out the Fire,&#148; based on a calypso
        recording he first heard on a 78-rpm disk owned by his grandparents.
        In one corner, he invites visitors to try the hand-cranked Victrola on
        which that song played. Why this recording? It made an impression on
        him as a child. As an adult, he says he asked, &#147;Why can&#146;t these
        guys get a music video? What about all that recorded music that&#146;s
        been forgotten?&#148;<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jaeger says
          he sees ethnic music as the &#147;secret sub-basement of pop music.&#148; The
          allure of Jaeger&#146;s film is that he takes us rummaging around down
          there with him. <br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He got the
          idea for his newest film after hearing a jazz tune from the 1930s while
          listening one day to WMUA in Amherst. &#147;I said, &#145;This is cartoon
          music and I have to find it.&#146;&#148;<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Films
            central</b><br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While it&#146;s
          easy to walk past the VCR, the films are a vital part of the show.
          In 10 minutes, viewers not only get a way to look at Jaeger&#146;s
          prints and drawings, they get a reason. He is at heart a performance
          artist. The logistics are on the walls here. The laughs are on tape.
          Because the films took so long to create, they seem to stand like little
          epochs in Jaeger&#146;s creative life. Many of the framed works, including
          of course the production stills from the films, seem to fall into those
          categories.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the hanging
          works, we see images of the landscapes that seemed to spur Jaeger&#146;s
          imagination as a young man, from subterranean passages in his native
          New York City to highway overpasses twisted and ruined by an earthquake
          in the Bay Area, where he lived before coming with his wife, Shoshana
          Marchand, to Northampton eight years ago. In a note to gallery visitors,
          Jaeger says he was mesmerized, as a child, by the crumbling cityscapes
          around him in New York, as that city struggled with financial ruin.
          He calls it the landscape of the &#147;formerly useful.&#148; 
        That bitter notion finds its way into other works here, including his
        drawing, &#147;The last gainfully employed lithographer in America.&#148; In
        the best of Jaeger&#146;s drawings, we&#146;re won not by his draftsmanship,
        which can appear hurried, but by the sly humor of his vision. That last
        lithographer sits at desk with a pair of scissors, carrots, a slice of
        pizza and other objects and appears to wear a tray on his head that holds
        three leafy plants.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In some
          pieces, Jaeger seems to have rushed on to his next idea. The pieces
          show a comfort and confidence, though, and a strong sense of balance
          in composition.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>When
            places speak</b><br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jaeger first
          tried to capture what he saw around him through cartooning. He enrolled
          at Yale University with plans to study animation as an art major, then
          opted to shift to an art school. He worked in commercial animation
          for a time in New York and San Francisco, but ended up taking a string
          of jobs divorced from the projects that were capturing his imagination
          nights and weekends.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;It&#146;s
          part of my long and not illustrious history of day jobs,&#148; 
        he said. He was working at a San Francisco print shop when he began the
        film &#147;Big Concrete Place.&#148; An old concrete plant nearby had
        been speaking to him, in that manner of places that can&#146;t stand
        still. Jaeger invented the notion of a robot-like man who inhabits such
        a &#147;formerly useful&#148; 
        place _ a man that&#146;s a misfit. The film propels the character through
        a series of emotional ups and downs.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In some
          ways, it seems a maiden voyage for an animator, but shows a technical
          proficiency. Like all animated films, even a short work is a big undertaking.
          As with all his works, he holds &#147;coloring parties&#148; at which
          friends help rough out the frames that will be shot in sequence to
          make figures move. It was edited the old-fashioned way, with cuts and
          splices. Sound was added later.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After years
          of thinking in pictures, he says he was confronted with the difficulty
          of building sound into his story. &#147;I saw this learning curve yawning
          before me of sound effects design,&#148; 
        he said. &#147;If you want a real esoteric sound, you&#146;ve got to
        close your eyes and meditate and decide what&#146;s going to make that
        sound.&#148;<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Dreams
            in motion</b><br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After moving
          to Northampton, Jaeger and Marchand collaborated on a project that
          seems to have been stimulated by the nightmarish themes in the filmmaker&#146;s
          work. They began publishing a 
        &#145;zine called &#147;Dream World News,&#148; in which they gave accounts
        of people&#146;s actual dreams, written in the no-nonsense style of the
        wire services. &#147;People believe what they read when it&#146;s presented
        as news,&#148; Jaeger said. Over the years, they published six issues.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He decided
          to play with that material in his &#147;5 Dreams,&#148; 
        a fast, funny and image-rich film with a narration that runs through
        a fistful of bizarre plots. With a narration by University of Massachusetts
        literature professor David Lenson, the film plays like a demented documentary.
        One brief stop-motion sequence in the film, of that subway train running
        through a tunnel, took Jaeger and two friends seven hours to shoot. The
        bit had come from a friend&#146;s actual dream.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gallery
          show includes the lyrics to a song that dream produced, entitled, &#147;If
          Wynton Marsalis Had a Toy Boat, Would It Sink?&#148; For good measure,
          if you snoop around enough, you can find the subway cars that ran through
          that underground tunnel and a print of the toy boat itself, with its
          main housing no more than a black cassette tape. The sequence that
          starts the film demands repeat viewing, if the flood of images is to
          gain any purchase in our minds. &#147;Stuff goes ripping by. You can&#146;t
          absorb it in one sitting,&#148; he said of that series.<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Jaeger,
          the Center for the Arts show offers a way to freeze the hectic pace
          of his movies and invite people to take a sustained look. He&#146;s
          opened the door on his quirky cabinet of wonder.</font></p>
