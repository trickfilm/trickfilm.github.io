&lt;p&gt;From the album “Lightning, Show Us Your Stuff,” on &lt;a href="https://www.yeproc.com/"&gt;Yep Roc Records&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The song&amp;rsquo;s lyrics and mood suggest the preachings of an old-time sidewalk prophet warning of imminent disaster. With this atmosphere as guide, I composited footage of Grant (it was important that he be barefoot) into a series of foreboding hand-painted environments. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly pleased with the color palette, especially the greens and yellows.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
With every project I try to learn at least one new technique or process. Here I pushed myself to develop some custom particle effects (steam, fog, and windblown leaves). I also assigned randomized parameters to some elements (like the trees losing their leaves and the birds converging on the ark-spaceship) for more naturalistic choreography.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Crumbs!</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/crumbs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/crumbs/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by a Franz Kafka story, this animated short answers the question of what really happens inside your toaster.
&lt;br&gt;
This animated short originated as a pandemic project to give me and my daughter something to do with our hands. We started with the enigmatic Franz Kafka story &amp;ldquo;The Cares of a Family Man,&amp;rdquo; which describes a mysterious object (or is it an animal?) named Odradek. As often happens, the storyboard quickly became overcomplicated and we found we were much more interested in the atmospherics than the narrative (not that the Kafka story has much of a plot). It was lockdown and we went with it, structuring it with a simple plot device about toast in a toaster. All that remains of the original concept is the one stop-motion shot of breakdancing Odradek, visible during the rave scene.&lt;br&gt;

This film is dedicated to her memory. A light dusting of climate anxiety and body horror complement the mood. The medical image appearing on the monitor in the MRI room is the spinal column of one of my early animation studio bosses / mentors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Take Off Your Skin (Island)</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/island/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/island/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Animation background art from &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/5097789/video/356545643"&gt;Take Off Your Skin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rabbit Tracks (Crashed Spaceship On Tracks)</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/crashed-spaceship-on-tracks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/crashed-spaceship-on-tracks/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Animation background art from &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/5097789/video/252212966"&gt;Rabbit Tracks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rabbit Tracks (Picnic In The Graveyard)</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/picnic-in-the-graveyard/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/picnic-in-the-graveyard/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Animation background art from &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/5097789/video/252212966"&gt;Rabbit Tracks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rabbit Tracks (Subway Station Mezzanine)</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/subway-station-mezzanine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/subway-station-mezzanine/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Animation background art from &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/5097789/video/356545643"&gt;Take Off Your Skin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>When Me Body Lay Down In The Grave</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/when-me-body-lay-down-in-the-grave/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/when-me-body-lay-down-in-the-grave/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The third in a series of “antique music videos” is a requiem for the numberless laborers who died building our physical and cultural environment.

Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, an originator of the Harlem Stride piano style. The animation reflects the multi-leveled, over-the-top delight and frantic silliness of this amazing musical performance.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In bringing these old musical treasures to new audiences I hope to recreate in some small way the experience of hearing this music for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fishwife</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/fishwife/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/fishwife/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;An enigmatic dancing man and a dog-headed woman celebrate the birth of a fish-child, then watch as it takes flight.

From the album &lt;a href="https://winterpillsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/all-my-lovely-goners"&gt;&amp;ldquo;All My Lovely Goners&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; on Signature Sounds / Soft Alarm.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I started out by searching YouTube for footage of freight trains. What I found was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAPibSxgIyw"&gt;Elizabeth Cotton singing &amp;ldquo;Freight Train&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; in 1957 on Pete Seeger&amp;rsquo;s TV show. (Who knew Pete Seeger had a TV show?)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then the algorithm threw the James Baldwin footage at me, and I decided to submit to the logic of the search engine, gathering imagery using a sort of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flarf_poetry"&gt;Flarf poetry&lt;/a&gt; approach. When I saw how Allen Ginsberg&amp;rsquo;s finger-gesture lined up with the piano riff, I had to go with it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I threw all this footage in the blender along with some handmade artwork and a bunch of Hi-8 footage I&amp;rsquo;d shot in the NYC subway in the 1990&amp;rsquo;s. The dreamlike final shot, a view out the front window of a train barreling down tracks overgrown with weeds and trees, was (and is) incredibly mysterious and compelling to me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>When Me Body Lay Down In The Grave (4 Vignettes)</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/when-me-body-lay-down-in-the-grave-4-vignettes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/when-me-body-lay-down-in-the-grave-4-vignettes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Production still from &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/5097789/video/263542742"&gt;When Me Body Lay Down In The Grave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ann Arbor Film Festival Sponsor Bumpers, 2003 &amp; 2005</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/ann-arbor-sponsor-bumpers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/ann-arbor-sponsor-bumpers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Digitally distressed archival footage and original animation; created for America&amp;rsquo;s oldest independent film festival.

Shot entirely outdoors in various weed-choked, industrial-looking locations in Northampton, Massachusetts, the film draws a parallel between these neglected, formerly useful sites which have gone to seed, and the musical treasures which the ever-changing machineries of cultural production have left in obscurity. Shot on 16mm film during the hottest week of the year.s&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Out The Fire</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/out-the-fire/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 1999 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/out-the-fire/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;An antique music video homage to the animation of the Fleischer Studios, set to a 1946 calypso about the New York City Fire Department. The film functions as a fun cartoon but also mourns the disappeared past of New York and asserts the power of music as a mechanism for retrieving the unretrievable. Cel and paper animation, shot on 16mm film.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Major W.E. Power (Inspector Constabulary) was also an officer in the Trinidad Fire Brigade. William O&amp;rsquo;Dwyer served as Mayor of New York City from 1946 to 1950.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>5 DREAMS</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/5-dreams/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 1997 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/5-dreams/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A rapid-fire collage of dream-inspired animation, this 16mm film highlights animation’s historical kinship with the dream world, a protean realm where anything can turn into anything. “A fireworks of visual imagination and surreal abstraction” — Victoria (BC) Independent Film &amp;amp; Video Festival.
