&lt;br&gt;
Although the Unification Church no longer uses the hotel as an industrial-scale dorm for thousands of Moonies, apparently &lt;a href="https://observer.com/2011/06/caught-between-the-moonies-and-new-york-city-the-new-yorker-hotels-office-idea/"&gt;they do still own the building&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Varick &amp; Houston, Looking Southwest</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/varick-houston-looking-southwest/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/varick-houston-looking-southwest/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My nephew put me onto this &lt;a href="https://www.lomography.com/films/871968580-ultrafine-jazzy-blues/photos"&gt;funky film stock&lt;/a&gt; so I bought some to celebrate the 50th birthday of my &lt;a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/hands-on-review/classic-camera-review-nikkormat-ft-2-the-poor-man%E2%80%99s-nikon-f"&gt;Nikkormat FT2&lt;/a&gt;. (The lens is a little sticky, but other than that the camera is basically good as new. Can you imagine any digital camera lasting half that long?). After stewing in the digital swamp for so long, shooting film felt like a clean breeze &amp;ndash; yes, I still did the montage &amp;amp; color tweaks in Photoshop.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I shot this same photomontage on the same corner with the same camera in 1995, while I was wandering around a very different New York shooting images for what eventually became &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/5097789/video/228068003"&gt;5 DREAMS&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;s something pleasing about the proportions of that building. I&amp;rsquo;ll post the old shots if I ever find them &amp;ndash; I really ought to digitize those images, some of them are probably pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dream | Bread Handler</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dream-bread-handler/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dream-bread-handler/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Steam Creature</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/steam-creature/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/steam-creature/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Fish And Skulls Under Old Washington Street El, Boston, 1985</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/fish-and-skulls-under-old-washington-street-el-boston-1985/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/fish-and-skulls-under-old-washington-street-el-boston-1985/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Good old &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2GZrEhYyT40"&gt;Harry The Greek&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;, where I got my first pair of safety shoes. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the background: Dudley Station on the old Orange Line elevated line. The platforms were made of wood, and a &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s Make Every Day Safe Driving Day&amp;rdquo; billboard, featuring a &lt;a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/56/13/99/561399a883ee46ae8931506b3db157e2.jpg"&gt;likeness of Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt;, remained remarkably intact 30+ years on, probably because its location directly over the tracks made it vandal-proof.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The photo was taken during a big sewer main upgrade project which turned loose an unbelievable number of rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ann Arbor Film Festival Sponsor Bumpers, 2003 &amp; 2005</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/ann-arbor-sponsor-bumpers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/ann-arbor-sponsor-bumpers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Digitally distressed archival footage and original animation; created for America&amp;rsquo;s oldest independent film festival. Digitally composited and output direct to 16mm film.&lt;br&gt;

Shot entirely outdoors in various weed-choked, industrial-looking locations in Northampton, Massachusetts, the film draws a parallel between these neglected, formerly useful sites which have gone to seed, and the musical treasures which the ever-changing machineries of cultural production have left in obscurity. Shot on 16mm film during the hottest week of the year.s&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Out The Fire</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/out-the-fire/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 1999 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/out-the-fire/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;An antique music video homage to the animation of the Fleischer Studios, set to a 1946 calypso about the New York City Fire Department. The film functions as a fun cartoon but also mourns the disappeared past of New York and asserts the power of music as a mechanism for retrieving the unretrievable. Cel and paper animation, shot on 16mm film.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Major W.E. Power (Inspector Constabulary) was also an officer in the Trinidad Fire Brigade. William O&amp;rsquo;Dwyer served as Mayor of New York City from 1946 to 1950.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>5 DREAMS</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/5-dreams/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 1997 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/5-dreams/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A rapid-fire collage of dream-inspired animation, this 16mm film highlights animation’s historical kinship with the dream world, a protean realm where anything can turn into anything. “A fireworks of visual imagination and surreal abstraction” — Victoria (BC) Independent Film &amp;amp; Video Festival. Mixed 2D and 3D techniques, including drawing, collage, xerography, stop-motion, and digital animation, shot on 16mm film.

Dark and surreal in the manner of Svankmajer and Road Runner cartoons, the film conjures a world in which characters’ fates are controlled by capricious objects (or animators).

No idea where this institutional-looking bathroom was. All I know is that it was 1987, I was fresh out of school, and shooting Tri-X.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dock Street, Brooklyn</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dock-street-brooklyn/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 1986 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dock-street-brooklyn/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Manhattan Bridge Underside</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/manhattan-bridge-underside/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 1986 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/manhattan-bridge-underside/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
