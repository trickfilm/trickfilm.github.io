He insisted on filing an incident report, so I had to as well.

It was raining buckets and the place was about to close. The girl behind the counter kept yelling into her phone (it was a little hard to tell when she was talking to us and when she wasn&amp;rsquo;t) and the screen was smashed, so she could only use the phone by voice commands. She explained that she was trying to text her boyfriend, who was listed in her contacts as &amp;lsquo;Satan&amp;rsquo;.</description></item><item><title>Picking Up Printing Supplies Of Questionable Provenance In Abandoned Court Street Office Building, ca. 1980</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/picking-up-printing-supplies-of-questionable-provenance-in-abandoned-court-street-office-building-ca-1980/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/picking-up-printing-supplies-of-questionable-provenance-in-abandoned-court-street-office-building-ca-1980/</guid><description>I had an after-school job at a quick-print shop in Brooklyn Heights. My job duties included picking up batches of stolen printing supplies from the drop point, an abandoned upper floor of a sketchy Court St office building. Sometimes I went in the company of my counterpart, a black kid who worked for the Xerox place down the street, with whose Hasidic owners my boss, a hard-drinking Italian named Frank, had a prickly competitive / collaborative relationship.</description></item><item><title>Motorman, WTF?</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/motorman-wtf/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/motorman-wtf/</guid><description>This really happened.</description></item><item><title>This Really Happened (Bonfire In Abandoned Truck)</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/this-really-happened-bonfire-in-abandoned-truck/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/this-really-happened-bonfire-in-abandoned-truck/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Man From Galaxy Seven</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/the-man-from-galaxy-seven/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/the-man-from-galaxy-seven/</guid><description>OK, who remembers this guy?</description></item><item><title>A Ride To Work</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/a-ride-to-work/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/a-ride-to-work/</guid><description>A reasonably accurate reconstruction of a real conversation with Corey Smithson</description></item><item><title>Greg &amp; Harvey At Work</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/greg-harvey-at-work/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 1989 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/greg-harvey-at-work/</guid><description>A representation of one memorable day at the printing shop I worked at in SFO. Harvey was my boss and Greg was one of the pressmen. Greg was also a member of the Oakland Hell&amp;rsquo;s Angels (in fact he&amp;rsquo;d left his home in the Midwest to ride with them, his local Angels chapter being insufficiently badass, I guess). Wherever Greg went, bizarre stuff happened: on this particular day, Greg popped his head into our room after having gotten into a knife fight at the deli across the street, blood cascading from his face.</description></item></channel></rss>
