Whenever I left one of these jobs, I&amp;rsquo;d draw the faces of my co-workers from memory. I can remember stories and details about some of these folks; others are completely missing from my memory.</description></item><item><title>Incident Report</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/incident-report/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/incident-report/</guid><description>Dude falsely accused me of bumping into his car at the dog path parking lot. He insisted on filing an incident report, so I had to as well. Presumably his claim was rejected.</description></item><item><title>One Alcohol-Soaked Evening In London</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/one-alcohol-soaked-evening-in-london/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/one-alcohol-soaked-evening-in-london/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Text Satan!</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/text-satan/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/text-satan/</guid><description>Some co-workers and I stopped into this beaten-down Italian pastry shop in New Haven one evening. It was raining buckets and the place was about to close. The girl behind the counter kept yelling into her phone (it was a little hard to tell when she was talking to us and when she wasn&amp;rsquo;t) and the screen was smashed, so she could only use the phone by voice commands. She explained that she was trying to text her boyfriend, who was listed in her contacts as &amp;lsquo;Satan&amp;rsquo;.</description></item><item><title>Picking Up Printing Supplies Of Questionable Provenance In Abandoned Court Street Office Building, ca. 1980</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/picking-up-printing-supplies-of-questionable-provenance-in-abandoned-court-street-office-building-ca-1980/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/picking-up-printing-supplies-of-questionable-provenance-in-abandoned-court-street-office-building-ca-1980/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Motorman, WTF?</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/motorman-wtf/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/motorman-wtf/</guid><description>This really happened.</description></item><item><title>Mark Lepore, Drawn From Memory</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/mark-lepore-drawn-from-memory/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/mark-lepore-drawn-from-memory/</guid><description>Mark Lepore was my graduate advisor and mentor at Mass Art.
The first day of my second year of grad school was 9/11.
I got caught in traffic and arrived late for Mark&amp;rsquo;s graduate seminar. As the only one who knew what was going on outside the dark, soundproof room where the class met, it fell to me to tell Mark and the other grad students what I&amp;rsquo;d been hearing on the radio on the way in.</description></item><item><title>7th Avenue BMT Station, Painted From Memory</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/7th-avenue-bmt-station-painted-from-memory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/7th-avenue-bmt-station-painted-from-memory/</guid><description/></item><item><title>With Koko At Haight Ashbury Music Store, 8/19/1996</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/with-koko-at-haight-ashbury-music-store-1996/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/with-koko-at-haight-ashbury-music-store-1996/</guid><description/></item><item><title>This Really Happened (Bonfire In Abandoned Truck)</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/this-really-happened-bonfire-in-abandoned-truck/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/this-really-happened-bonfire-in-abandoned-truck/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Man From Galaxy Seven</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/the-man-from-galaxy-seven/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/the-man-from-galaxy-seven/</guid><description>OK, who remembers this guy?</description></item><item><title>Dad Paying Bills Late At Night</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dad-paying-bills-late-at-night/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dad-paying-bills-late-at-night/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Prudential Station Drawn From Memory</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/prudential-station-drawn-from-memory/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/prudential-station-drawn-from-memory/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Greg &amp; Harvey At Work</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/greg-harvey-at-work/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 1989 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/greg-harvey-at-work/</guid><description>A representation of one memorable day at the printing shop I worked at in SFO. Harvey was my boss and Greg was one of the pressmen. Greg was also a member of the Oakland Hell&amp;rsquo;s Angels (in fact he&amp;rsquo;d left his home in the Midwest to ride with them, his local Angels chapter being insufficiently badass, I guess). Wherever Greg went, bizarre stuff happened: on this particular day, Greg popped his head into our room after having gotten into a knife fight at the deli across the street, blood cascading from his face.</description></item></channel></rss>
