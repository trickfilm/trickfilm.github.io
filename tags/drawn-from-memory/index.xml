Immigrant women sitting shoulder-to-shoulder behind rows of sewing machines. I believe it ran 24/7. Today this spot is probably 10 miles from the nearest factory.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Everybody I Ever Worked With From 1980 To 1993 Or So, Drawn From Memory</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/everybody-i-ever-worked-with-from-1980-to-1993-or-so-drawn-from-memory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/everybody-i-ever-worked-with-from-1980-to-1993-or-so-drawn-from-memory/</guid><description>&lt;p>In my teenage years and 20&amp;rsquo;s, I had a ton of jobs: office-assistant-gopher at a travel bureau and an ad agency; various quick-print and xerox shops; a whole bunch of offset lithography and pre-press shops; a couple of scenic construction companies and several animation studios; plus some others I&amp;rsquo;m probably forgetting.
Whenever I left one of these jobs, I&amp;rsquo;d draw the faces of my co-workers from memory.
I can remember stories and details about some of these folks; others are completely missing from my memory.
If you recognize yourself, let me know!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Incident Report</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/incident-report/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/incident-report/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dude falsely accused me of bumping into his car at the dog path parking lot. He insisted on filing an incident report, so I had to as well.

It was raining buckets and the place was about to close. The girl behind the counter kept yelling into her phone (it was a little hard to tell when she was talking to us and when she wasn&amp;rsquo;t) and the screen was smashed, so she could only use the phone by voice commands. She explained that she was trying to text her boyfriend, who was listed in her contacts as &amp;lsquo;Satan&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Picking Up Printing Supplies Of Questionable Provenance In Abandoned Court Street Office Building, ca. 1980</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/picking-up-printing-supplies-of-questionable-provenance-in-abandoned-court-street-office-building-ca-1980/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/picking-up-printing-supplies-of-questionable-provenance-in-abandoned-court-street-office-building-ca-1980/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had an after-school job at a quick-print shop in Brooklyn Heights. My job duties included picking up batches of stolen printing supplies from the drop point, an abandoned upper floor of a sketchy Court St office building. Sometimes I went in the company of my counterpart, a black kid who worked for the Xerox place down the street, with whose Hasidic owners my boss, a hard-drinking Italian named &lt;a href="https://www.remsenprinting.com/about/">Frank&lt;/a>, had a prickly competitive / collaborative relationship. “Hey kid, go down to the jews and borrow a case of paper.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Motorman, WTF?</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/motorman-wtf/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/motorman-wtf/</guid><description>&lt;p>This really happened.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mark Lepore, Drawn From Memory</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/mark-lepore-drawn-from-memory/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/mark-lepore-drawn-from-memory/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://filmmakermagazine.com/2032-mark-lapore-53/">Mark Lepore&lt;/a> was my graduate advisor and mentor at Mass Art.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first day of my second year of grad school was 9/11.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I got caught in traffic and arrived late for Mark&amp;rsquo;s graduate seminar. As the only one who knew what was going on outside the dark, soundproof room where the class met, it fell to me to tell Mark and the other grad students what I&amp;rsquo;d been hearing on the radio on the way in. Mark, an ex-New Yorker like me, freaked out and we all ran down the hall to a tiny office where a janitor was watching the news on a beaten-down black &amp;amp; white TV. We arrived just in time to see the second tower collapse.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>7th Avenue BMT Station, Painted From Memory</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/7th-avenue-bmt-station-painted-from-memory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/7th-avenue-bmt-station-painted-from-memory/</guid><description/></item><item><title>With Koko At Haight Ashbury Music Store, 8/19/1996</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/with-koko-at-haight-ashbury-music-store-1996/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/with-koko-at-haight-ashbury-music-store-1996/</guid><description/></item><item><title>This Really Happened (Bonfire In Abandoned Truck)</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/this-really-happened-bonfire-in-abandoned-truck/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/this-really-happened-bonfire-in-abandoned-truck/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Man From Galaxy Seven</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/the-man-from-galaxy-seven/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/the-man-from-galaxy-seven/</guid><description>&lt;p>OK, who remembers this guy?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dad Paying Bills Late At Night</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dad-paying-bills-late-at-night/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dad-paying-bills-late-at-night/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Prudential Station Drawn From Memory</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/prudential-station-drawn-from-memory/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/prudential-station-drawn-from-memory/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Greg &amp; Harvey At Work</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/greg-harvey-at-work/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 1989 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/greg-harvey-at-work/</guid><description>&lt;p>A representation of one memorable day at the printing shop I worked at in SFO. Harvey was my boss and Greg was one of the pressmen. Greg was also a member of the Oakland Hell&amp;rsquo;s Angels (in fact he&amp;rsquo;d left his home in the Midwest to ride with them, his local Angels chapter being insufficiently badass, I guess). Wherever Greg went, bizarre stuff happened: on this particular day, Greg popped his head into our room after having gotten into a knife fight at the deli across the street, blood cascading from his face. We called an ambulance (against Greg&amp;rsquo;s protestations) and Harvey buried his face in his hands, trying to unsee the whole scene.
In the deep background, a running figure is pursued by a guy wielding an axe. This also really happened, though on a different day.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
