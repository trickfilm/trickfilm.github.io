This film is dedicated to her memory. A light dusting of climate anxiety and body horror complement the mood. The medical image appearing on the monitor in the MRI room is the spinal column of one of my early animation studio bosses / mentors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>When Me Body Lay Down In The Grave</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/when-me-body-lay-down-in-the-grave/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/when-me-body-lay-down-in-the-grave/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The third in a series of “antique music videos” is a requiem for the numberless laborers who died building our physical and cultural environment. A haunting, minor-key shout recorded in 1938 accompanies the imagery of hard labor and death in the subterranean spaces and skyscraper steelwork of New York.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rabbit Tracks</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/rabbit-tracks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/rabbit-tracks/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A journey through a mortality-infused landscape populated by mysterious chickens, inconvenient frogs, and other cartoonish creatures.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Carolina Shout</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/carolina-shout/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/carolina-shout/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Another in a series of “antique music videos,” set to a 1921 composition by jazz pioneer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_P._Johnson"&gt;James P. Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, an originator of the Harlem Stride piano style. The animation reflects the multi-leveled, over-the-top delight and frantic silliness of this amazing musical performance.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In bringing these old musical treasures to new audiences I hope to recreate in some small way the experience of hearing this music for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
