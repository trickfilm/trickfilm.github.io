A relic of the campaign to encourage the use of ZIP codes (introduced in 1963), images of Mister Zip were still visible in post offices when I was a kid. His lumpen body and rubber-hose limbs were completely without refinement, not at all like the highly abstracted, geometric style of other 1960&amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp; 70&amp;rsquo;s cartoons. He seemed perpetually victimized by his surroundings, hardly a desirable trait in a mailman. I found his pathetic and primitive quality compelling, and it made me want to place him in surreal and metaphorical situations.
This painting mattered to me because I started out trying to paint the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge from a photo, but got discouraged because of my sloppy brushwork. &amp;ldquo;It looks like a mess of goddam chicken bones,&amp;rdquo; I remember thinking â€” and then the lightbulb lit up! Bones = structural steelwork.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mister Zip With Moose And Stalin</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/mister-zip-with-moose-and-stalin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 1992 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/mister-zip-with-moose-and-stalin/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mister Zip With Hose</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/mister-zip-with-hose/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 1992 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/mister-zip-with-hose/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mister Zip Driving AIDS Bus</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/mister-zip-driving-aids-bus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 1992 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/mister-zip-driving-aids-bus/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Memo Pad Comic</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/memo-pad-comic/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 1990 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/memo-pad-comic/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
