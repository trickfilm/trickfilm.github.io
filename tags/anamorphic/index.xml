These are mounted on ready-made hexagonal painting panels with custom-built beveled enclosures, creating the illusion of a 3D cube. You can assemble these three little scenes into any number of narratives; pick one that floats your boat.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tube Cathedral 2</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/tube-cathedral-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/tube-cathedral-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Another anamorphic construction, designed in OnShape CAD.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Extended Family | James Jamerson At Home</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/extended-family-james-jamerson-at-home/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/extended-family-james-jamerson-at-home/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I was 9 or 10, my mom took me to a survey of anamorphic art at the Brooklyn Museum. This exhibition spanned continents and centuries (from Holbein’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ambassadors_(Holbein)"&gt;The Ambassadors&lt;/a&gt; to contemporary works) and it’s no exaggeration to say it blew my young mind permanently. Anamorphic and forced-perspective miniature environments have fascinated me ever since. Lately I’ve been designing and constructing them using CAD software, 3D printing, and laser cutting technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fimbel Lab Anamorphic Logo</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/fimbel-lab-anamorphic-logo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/fimbel-lab-anamorphic-logo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This was one of my first attempts to build an anamorphic object using CAD software. Come by the &lt;a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/academics/centers-and-facilities/fimbel-maker-innovation-lab"&gt;Mount Holyoke Makerspace&lt;/a&gt; some time and see it! My colleagues Kris Camp and Shani Mensing were instrumental in fabricating this thing. The original logo was designed by Joyce He.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
