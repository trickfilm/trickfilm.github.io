The place was staffed by women who had clearly been avid JFK supporters in 1960 &amp;ndash; they were all wearing their vintage campaign buttons and talking about JFK like they were expecting him to show up any minute &amp;ndash; and a weird mood prevailed. We realized that it was November 22, the anniversary of JFK&amp;rsquo;s assassination.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dream | Working For

+0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/tap-dancer-in-power-plant/</guid><description>&lt;p>This enigmatic, top-hatted character appeared in a dream, performing a very solemn and dignified sort of dance. In dress and bearing he resembled some old-time hoofer like Bojangles Robinson or Sandman Sims, though it wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly a tap dance, more a soft shoe / buck dance type of thing &amp;ndash; anyway, it was a compelling and emotionally charged image which evoked something of my childhood immersion in old movies and my parents&amp;rsquo; 78 records. A few years later he ended up as a character in my animated film &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/5097789/video/83167856">Fishwife&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
For the Fishwife dance animation, I rotoscoped video of a contemporary buck dancer whose motion had the right vibe. His name escapes me, but I do remember that tracking him down to get permission was no small feat. He was a bit confused by my asking to use his roto&amp;rsquo;d likeness in the film, and he didn&amp;rsquo;t want his name in the credits. Happily he did say yes to the whole thing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dream In Which I Am Spiderman And Also A Freelance Photographer</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dream-in-which-i-am-spiderman-and-also-a-freelance-photographer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dream-in-which-i-am-spiderman-and-also-a-freelance-photographer/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dream | Z-Vox</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dream-z-vox/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dream-z-vox/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dream | A 50 Pound Bag Of Photoshop</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dream-a-50-pound-bag-of-photoshop/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dream-a-50-pound-bag-of-photoshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>and yes, I did make the image in photoshop&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5 Dreams (Underwater City)</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/5-dreams-underwater-city/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 1997 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/5-dreams-underwater-city/</guid><description>&lt;p>Production art from &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/5097789/video/228068003">5 Dreams&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5 Dreams (Daylight Savings Time)</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/5-dreams-daylight-savings-time/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 1997 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/5-dreams-daylight-savings-time/</guid><description>&lt;p>Production art from &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/5097789/video/228068003">5 Dreams&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5 Dreams (AIDS Quilt Bathroom Tiles)</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/5-dreams-aids-quilt-bathroom-tiles/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 1997 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/5-dreams-aids-quilt-bathroom-tiles/</guid><description>&lt;p>Production art from &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/5097789/video/228068003">5 Dreams&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dream | Late Model Cars Being Swept Into The Sea</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dream-late-model-cars-being-swept-into-the-sea/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 1994 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dream-late-model-cars-being-swept-into-the-sea/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dream Of Sarge</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dream-of-sarge/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 1989 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dream-of-sarge/</guid><description>&lt;p>Assembled one day in the late 1980&amp;rsquo;s while under the heavy influence of &lt;a href="https://whitney.org/collection/works/9517">Jess Collins&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dream Of Blondie And The Blind Actors</title><link>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dream-of-blondie-and-the-blind-actors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 1989 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trickfilm.github.io/art/dream-of-blondie-and-the-blind-actors/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another nugget from my Jess Collins phase.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
