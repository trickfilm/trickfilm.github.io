A few years later he ended up as a character in my animated film Fishwife.
For the Fishwife dance animation, I rotoscoped video of a contemporary buck dancer whose motion had the right vibe. His name escapes me, but I do remember that tracking him down to get permission was no small feat. He was a bit confused by my asking to use his roto&rsquo;d likeness in the film, and he didn&rsquo;t want his name in the credits. Happily he did say yes to the whole thing.
